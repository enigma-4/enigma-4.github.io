H4A provides two main features, medical provider and prescription medicine searching. Both follow the same general principles, but the medical provider search pulls from a spreadsheet of aggregated data while the prescription medicine search uses real-time web scraping. Once the user has chosen the procedure/drug they would like to search for (as well as specific information such as dosage for medications), the website displays options from the most popular clinics and pharmacies. Users can also click on each option to find the nearest location to them. The DevPost for this project can be accessed [here](https://devpost.com/software/betterx)

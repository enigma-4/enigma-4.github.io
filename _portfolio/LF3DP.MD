Sports Statistics and Gaming has always been a strong interest of our team. Originally, we sought to create an odds-finding model. When planning this we thought about what sports odds truly were and came to the conclusion that sports odds are just an abstract estimate of a chaotic event’s probability. A game’s odds are not an objective existing proven fact, but rather a subjective perception of an outcome, created by a casino, model, or bookie. We strayed further down this ideological rabbit hole of what odds truly meant, and in doing so, thought of a new way to create them. Instead of using a model, scouting players, or looking at historical trends, we’d create odds by crowdsourcing public opinion, and through the law of large numbers, generate odds that accurately mirror the perceived consensus outcome of an event. This then led to the question of how to get this group consensus. Simple: have people put their money where their mouth is. We’d create a betting platform where the odds are solely determined by how the users decide to place their bets.
